                        <h3>Data Research and Project Intent</h3>
                         <p>With the growth of social network in the world it is apparent that a good portion of internet users at least have a Facebook or even a Twitter account. With this developers have worked to allow users to shop with their Twitter/Facebook logins creating less headache on the user to have to remember all their accounts. Although Facebook started this trend twitter has been stepping up to the plate to also allow their users to use their accounts for other websites such has blogging websites, and even shopping websites in which they would use their twitter login information to make payments on said shopping sites.</p>

                        <p>We would need to use JSON-P particularly because the fact it is a client side data source.  It is also developed in in a way that API’s were specifically intended to. With that being said it allows developers to access the data client side regardless of what server is requesting access to it. This is important to developers to develop websites so that the user will be able to access this data that is outside of the original web server.</p> 

                        <p>Based on the search results for JSON – P it has become clear that some Native device features may not pair well with these data resources. However some of the data resources I find that could use some of the Native device features would be the specifically the Shopping category as many user like to find out where the closest shopping malls may be, or where the nearest item they may be searching for it as thus using the Geolocation feature natively found on many devices today. Another is the Social category, since in today’s society everyone and I mean everyone takes pictures of everything. You could integrate the camera into this particular Social API’s and allow the user to post pictures they have just taken.</p>

                        <p>Intentions I have for my Demo app are to include the required source in which is Twitter, however along with this source I will also be including a Instagram, which is a photo sharing form of social networking.</p>

                        <p>Workflow has never been my cup of tea, however over the past couple months and the required time needed to accomplish each project for the past couple classes I have found my self to be getting better with the workflow piece. I used to procrastinate and do the entire project on the last day, and then submit it an hour or sometime even minutes before the deadline. Even though I still struggle with workflow I have made it a point to at least one day ahead of the project timeline.</p>

                    <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
                        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>In my demo application I have already included the Section tag, however some other things I could do to make my application more accessible is include the title attribute in the appropriate HTML tags. Also including the alt attribute in image tag, to give a user who may be blind the opportunity for the screen reader program of their choice to output the description of the image.  Some other instance for changing my HTML on my Demo application may include removing the standard HTML styling attributes and using a CSS styling property. Another simple addition I could add to my Demo application is a Language identifier. </p>

                        <p>Some of the common frustrations I see among the examples are Links and Headline. It appears that the Screen Read made by JAWS can interpret web pages very quickly however it interprets the entire context, so for instance say a user only really needs to read the New article or the actual content of the page it may take a second or two for the screen reader to get to that content due to the development of the HTML. By identifying or sectioning your HTML you can enable such screen readers to quickly bypass headers with multiple links.  Another problem is Tables; I have seen multiple websites that use tables to break up text or to wrap text into. This can become extremely frustrating to users who use Screen Readers because the layout of say table and the design of the Screen Reader program, The program is designed to read in standard form left to right. When you wrap text into a table in such format you have the page split into two columns left and right the screen reader will the page across left to right instead of reading the content in its intended form.</p>

                        <p>One of the most commonly known devices designed specifically to support Accessibility is the Hearing Aid, first electronic hearing aid created in 1898. The hearing aid is a device that amplifies the sound, in such a fashion that assists those who have hearing disability.</p>

                        <p>Another devices or collage of devices is the telephone. If you remember the touch-tone phones with the enormously huge buttons, these type of phones were designed for those who needed visual assistance, with the larger button it enabled user who had a hard time seeing smaller visuals. Another thing with this is touch-tone, with the press of each button the device would sound off with a different tone, this allowed those who are completely visually impaired know what button or number was being dialed.</p>

                        <p>Amongst the vast amount of mobile application on both markets today the most notable that I noticed that were designed for accessibility for the Android is “Mobile Accessibility”. The application itself is quite pricy for its intended us which I do not agree with however it is free if you are a Sprint User. The purpose of this application is to simply the use of mobile phones it provides a splash page with the necessity application a user would use and make it visually accessible for those with impaired hearing. The application is also designed to assist those with impaired vision. The application is designed to read text as well as a speech recognition system that allows a user to speak to the device and it would write out what was said.</p>

                        <p>Another application that I notice is the entire OS of both Android and iOS. Both devices have accessibility options to assist those with impaired vision or hearing. With iOS you have Voiceover that works with the Zoom feature to allow a user to magnify text and with that the voice over reads the text to the user. iOS also has Siri which is a feature/application that allows a user to do pretty much anything just by telling the phone to do something or telling Siri I guess. Android as a similar application called Google Voice that does much of the same thing from allowing user to make voice activated calls, reading voicemails yes I said reading as well as text messages.</p>
